# Paul's Pre-Bundled DCS kitting. Please credit Fooblitzky and me if you are using these

*#bababaul#0089 on discord*

3D kit with the majority of caps from Fooblitzky's base branch. Modifiers are using text+icon, as is typical SP and will be used in my own personal sets

Each cap has altered properties under alphas and mods
- Legend 
- Cap side
- Cap top

*It is up to you to texture these however you wish. FBX was not playing nice so I reccomend using .obj (as uploaded)*
